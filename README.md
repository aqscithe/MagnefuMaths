# MagnefuMaths

## Description
Math library used in MagnefuEngine.  Feel free to use it how you please. 
As of now it includes some common math functions, vectors, matrices and 
a quaternion class. As I build out the engine I will continue to add, 
make edits and optimizations to this library.

When adding it to your project be sure to exclude 'Examples.cpp'
from your project, as it includes a main() function.

Salut!
